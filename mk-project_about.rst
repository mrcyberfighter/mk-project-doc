A word from the author
++++++++++++++++++++++

I must recognize to write a program which **generates** and **parse** *severals files* is **painfull** in the **C** *programming language*.

But I hope *that the community will adopt this usefull tool...*

.. Which I will use starting every new project with,

.. because I use a :abbr:`I.T.E (Integrated Terminals Editor)` editor named `it-edit <http://www.open-source-projects.net/IT-Edit/IT-Edit_presentation.html>`_,

.. so I have a terminal on my sidebar (with another otherwere) and I now the *targets* (I'm not an :abbr:`I.D.E (Integrated Development Environment)` **zombie**).

I dislike :abbr:`I.D.E (Integrated Development Environment)`'s because their advantages is their weak point:

  They let you make forget everything once you have configurate their interface.

  Even how to build your program (i.e. The command line to build your program, you know it ?).

*I use the commandline everyday* and by doing a **good compromise** between **automating task** and doesn't forget **how the command works**.

Is issue **mk-project**...

The adding of the ``Edit terminals`` is suppose for :program:`ed`, :program:`vi`, :program:`emacs`, etc users.

And the :abbr:`G.U.I (Graphical User Interface)` :program:`make` targets launching can be extend :ref:`like explain in the presentation <futur-of-mk-project>`.

**Finally**: I hope you will join us to make **mk-project** support more and more programming languages.

:note: I have put all my *savoir-faire* in this project for you and the entire community.

Author final word:
------------------

I use :program:`mk-project` since the version **1.0** (spring *2016*) for my programs.

Accompanier with my `terminals integrated editor it-edit <http://www.open-source-projects.net/it-edit/it-edit>`_,

where I type my targets instead of using vim or any other :abbr:`T.U.I Terminal User Interface`.

I must confess that I do not use all the targets provided by mk-project.

My most used targets are:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make

  $ make -B

  $ make exec

  $ make fdebug

  $ make gdb

  $ make search-pattern argv="pattern"

  ...
